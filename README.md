            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hi, everyone. Welcome to my blog post. Have you ever had the experience of just finishing chatting with a friend about wanting new shoes, and the next second your phone serves you many sports brands and beautiful shoes? Or be shocked by a video you just watched, but later just find out that it was old news from years ago? While enjoying the boundless convenience of instant messaging, social media, and video sharing, we rarely consider the problems communication technology will bring us. Now, let's talk about the privacy and security issues in communication technologies and the ethical issues in creating and sharing media.</p >

            <h2>Data Collection: We Are Far More "Transparent" Than We Think</h2>
            <p>Most communication apps and platforms rely on data to optimize services, while this optimize their services, over-collection can make some of our private information not that private. App permissions and privacy policy terms which are usually so long that we don’t want to read before clicking "Agree", often allow companies to collect our contacts, location information, usage habits, and even device info. This aggregated and analyzed data can be really integrated, which means our social networks, activity patterns, and even psychological states could be grasped by third parties.</p>
            <h3>Statistic Support:</h3>
            <p>According to a survey, over 80% of users admit they never or rarely read privacy policies. An average mobile app requests around 25 permissions, many unrelated to its core functions.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Data Breaches and Cyber Attacks: When the Lake Dry Up, the Fish in the Lake Suffer</h2>
            <p>Even if companies don't intend harm, they can become the weak link for hackers. Server intrusions and database leaks happen frequently. Once your name, password, email, or even more sensitive information such as the ID number flows into the dark web, it can be used for identity theft, online scams, or targeted phishing.</p>
            <h3>Personal Example:</h3>
            <p> I once received a call from the police station (it is true that the phone number can only be used by the police office) and they told me that I was suspected of a local theft case around that week. It said that if I don’t want to be catched, I need to pay them 50,000 dollars. But the situation is that at that movement, I have been traveling abroad for almost a month! If I stay at home, I may really scramble for 50,000 dollars!</p>

            <h2>Deepfakes and Misinformation: When Seeing is No Longer Believing</h2>
            <p>Nowadays, the widespread use of Artificial intelligence has made creating highly realistic fake videos and audio alarmingly simple. It is a good development of technique, but when it is used to fabricate false statements by political figures or produce video and sounds to execute complex scams, it is harmful for us. When misinformation becomes "reality" and spreads virally on social networks, bad for the very foundation of societal trust.</p>
            <h3>Examples: </h3>
            <p>Can you find the difference between AI and human-made?</p>

            <br>
            <h2>Productions Counterfeition: Unfair Competition Between Us</h2>
            <p>The original aim of Artificial intelligence was to provide people with more entertainment and help more people experience the joy of creating videos and achieve their imaginations. But when the AI is used on academic articles or electronic goods sold, it is disrespected and unfair for the people working by themselves, readers and customers. People may also worry about whether the article they read is true and if they will be affected by those cheating competitors.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Copyright and Creative Attribution: Yours or Mine?</h2>
            <p>In social media, we can read through the things others have made and easily use them whenever we want. But casually using others' music, images, or article excerpts in blogs, videos, or podcasts is a common infringement. Many people will overlook this when making personal projects. Respecting intellectual property is not only a legal matter but also a respect for the creator's labor. Conversely, our own original content might be used by others without permission.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Readers</h2>
            <h3>Strengthen Password Management:</h3>
            <p>Use a unique and complex password for every important account. Using a password manager if needed.</p>
            <h3>Be Careful with Public Wi-Fi:</h3>
            <p>Avoid important communications or transactions on public networks. Do not try to connect with unknown Wi-Fi easily.</p>
            <h3>Clean Your Phone Regularly:</h3>
            <p>Regularly check your phone app permissions and disable unnecessary and unknown access.</p>
            <h3>Be an Information "Detective":</h3>
            <p>When you see shocking news, pause and check the source before telling others. Do not let yourself be a spreader of misinformation.</p>
            <h3>Think Before You Post:</h3>
            <p>Before posting content involving others or making comments, ask yourself: "Is this necessary? Is it true? Is it kind?"</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Technology itself is neither good nor bad. The miracle of connectivity brought by communication technologies should not come at the cost of privacy and ethics. So what we can do is to develop our "digital literacy". This is not only about protecting ourselves, but also about contributing to a more friendly and clean online environment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So starting today, let's try to be more mindful sharers, more careful information consumers, and more proactive privacy guardians. Because a healthy digital ecosystem begins with each of our clicks, shares, and moments of reflection.</p >
